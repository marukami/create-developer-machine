# Developer Machine Setup Scripts

This is a a set of scripts to setup all the tooling needed for a developer machines that I've needed before.

## Android

The Android script will installs and configure Android Studio Stable and Canary as release Dec 2021

* Android Studio, Beta and Alpha
* Android SDK CLI
  * API 29, 34
* Bump memory for Android Studio to 6 or 8GB
* Setup Zulu JDK 17 and 21
* Gradle default config based on system memory size
* Add `gw` alias for `./gradlew`

## Core

Setups up brew, shells, and some core tooling like

* git
* warp
* slack
* zoom


## Extras

A few tools that I use like bat, fork (Git GUI)

## JVM

Doing a little backend work from time to time. So, this is really just about adding maven right now.
