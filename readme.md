# Developer Machine Setup Scripts

This is a a set of scripts to setup all the tooling needed for a developer machines that I've needed before.

## Android

The Android script will installs and configure Android Studio Stable and Canary as release Dec 2021

* Android Studio
* Android SDK CLI
  * API 29, 30
* Bump memory for Android Studio to 2.5GB
* Setup Zulu JDK 8 and 11
* Gradle default config
* Adds a shell alias `gradleNuke` that will delete all local gradle files

## Core

Setups up brew, shells, and some core tooling like

* git
* iterm2
* slack
* zoom


## Extras

A few tools that I use like bat, fork (Git GUI)

## Flutter

I used to do Flutter, so, take this setup with some salt, as it may been a bit out of date.

## JVM

Doing a little backend work from time to time. So, this is really just about adding maven right now.
